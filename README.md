# Couple things to get this working.

1. Have a SFDC Developer or Enterprise Edition

4. Install Http Client (Used Apache)
      * http://hc.apache.org/downloads.cgi
      * 4.5tar.g
      * Uncompress in a folder
5. Install JSON framework
      * http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.json/json
      * Download 20140107 (You could try 20141113 with Java 8 if want to)
6. Created connected App in SFDC.  Goto Setup -> Create -> Apps.  Bottom of pag click New

      * API Name = TEST_REST_API
